# Zipfian
A simple word processing Python program to extract statistical information from natural language in relation to computational linguistical models and machine learning.

## Features
Zipfian reads a text file containing natural language, filters it and separates it into word tokens. The result is then analyzed to obtain insights into the statistical properties of the text.

## Usage
The script can be easily executed by passing the filename of the text file containing the natural language to analyze. The program automatically filters out unwanted characters to obtain alphanumerical text input.
```
py zipfian.py <filename>
```

## Dependencies
You need to have `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed to use Zipfian.
